Hey Jacob,

Thanks for taking the time to report this finding. Our team has started the
initial triage and efforts to independently reproduce the issue you=E2=80=
=99ve
outlined.

If you have a proof of concept readily available in addition to your
submission, that would help our team expedite the analysis.

We=E2=80=99ll provide an update once the issue has been triaged, likely ear=
ly next
week.

Thanks,
-mo
