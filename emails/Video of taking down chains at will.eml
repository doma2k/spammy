Hello I understand you're here, well look I'm not going to carry billions
in the foundations vulnerabilities when the foundation is just denying them
and I have completely concrete proof.

Taking the hub down for $210/30min is serious.

I understand that the foundation's security contractor does not think so
and quite frankly that's your problem.
