Hi Hi there,

I just want to let you know that today, numerous teams wasted their time,
discussing getting in touch with you, amulet.

Informal systems is of the belief that all communications relating to
security should go through you guys, as is the IBC team. If you are not
responsive to security reporters, you are utterly delinquent in your work.
There is now a wide consensus that this issue should not have been released
to the public because it can halt the cosmos hub.

I am writing this email out of respect for my colleagues at informal
systems. They want you in the loop but you're not in the loop. Can you
please get in the loop? I literally had a conversation with Milan today
about chasing you. I told him hey don't worry about it, they're going to do
what they're going to do. But he really wants you in the loop so get in the
loop please.

As yesterday, I have additional information to give you in incomplete
report format. I don't think anybody doubts that this is a universal
vulnerability. The only thing that is apparent is that it does not seem to
be worth a phone call to your team at amulet.

If you do not want to work on this issue come up please just let us know,
it will save everybody time and effort.

Cheers!

-Jacob
