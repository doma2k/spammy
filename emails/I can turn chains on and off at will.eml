Hey guys, I just want to let you know that I have evolved the technique
that I'm using such that I can now deprive a chain of liveness at will.

By now you have my phone number, you have my calendar, you have anything
that you might need to get a hold of me.

Now imagine that I wasn't a researcher and I was financially motivated.

I just turned the testnet off.

Can we please maybe get on a phone call?

I don't think that this is low criticality at all.

There are chains that depend on liveness, their liveness does stuff to user
funds.

 how is QSR going to rebalance portfolios and stuff if it doesn't make
blocks?

What could an attacker do with that?
