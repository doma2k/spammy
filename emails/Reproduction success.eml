Hi, I'm writing to let you know that I have successfully reproduced the
attack.

To be very direct, the attack is a lot worse than I thought.

In order to cut block production down to around 30 seconds per block, I
don't need to spend any gas at all.

So this is without going multi-Wallet and it's honestly trivial.
