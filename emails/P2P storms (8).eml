If you sign and broadcast the banana King transaction on the hub replicated
security testnet you will cause validators to miss blocks

Interestingly that's not even a valid transaction there because it has no
channel one.

I'm going to put a banana king transaction down channel 242 on hub mainnet,
that's the one on e-money.

How is your progress?

Additionally, I think we should work on mitigation.
