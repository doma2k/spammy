Greetings,

*"threatening language"*

We've heard that our communications with Amulet are, in the words of Ethan
Buchman, "laden with threatening language" and I just sat with Maria for
over an hour, and she is of the opinion that such threatening language does
not exist.

We would like examples of this threatening language or a formal statement
form the foundation that such threats did not occur. This is of course due
to the potential criminal and reputational liability issues that could come
from such false and damaging statements.

I am available in person any time to go through each e-mail.

*"waste of $70,000 and opportunity costs"*

I asked Amulet not to publish and told then that they did not understand
the issue.  I brought 14 people to cosmoverse.  Due to amulet's release of
information about a severe attack against my express wishes, I've not been
able to do anything other than work on security, because *every chain in
cosmos can be severely degraded with ease.*

Notional did not release this information.

*"attacking chain A from chain B"*

We are currently able to attack pion from producer resulting in severely
degraded performance on pion.  We believe that we can greatly enhance the
effectiveness of this attack, such that from a single chain we can degrade
or disable multiple counterparties through normal relayer operation.

Regards,

-Jacob
