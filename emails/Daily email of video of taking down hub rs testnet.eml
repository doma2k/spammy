Hi, so this has still not been acknowledged.

Therefore, I am writing once again to let you know that there's code that
can take down the hub rs testnet.... and any chain in cosmos without
restriction and that I've been faithfully and dutifully following Ethan
Buchman's instructions to follow Amulet's advice.  Since amulet hasn't been
in direct contact with me at any time despite numerous attempts on the part
of the Notional team to arrange a call to go through this, I really left
with only one salient suggestion which is of course to form a validator
working group on spam.

So I'm doing that.

This will be a group of validators that I'll have mutual NDAs with each
other and work directly on issues like this one.

Both the informal and hypha teams have been looped into the VWGoS
initiative.

Due to the lack of communication and severity of the issue, I've taken to
assuming that there is no communication between, for example, the amulet
team and the IBC team.



1) the guide document, scoped per Amulet way though I think we should
really consider issues like this holistically not atomically.

2) the video - taking down the cosmos hub rs testnet with a method that's
much more effective on mainnet

3) the analysis document

4) the repository

GitHub.com/notional-labs/spammy


------------

Please know that the security of cosmos is our key objective here.

I will once again leave my contact information and I exhort teams receiving
this email to ack this issue.
