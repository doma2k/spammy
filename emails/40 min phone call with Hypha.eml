Hi again,

Just wanted to let you know that we just had a 40 minute call with hypha
and came away with a clearer plan for how to handle P2P storms than in
nearly a month of emailing you.

Some of our esteemed colleagues at informal systems, continue to insist
that you be involved in this process. I disagree, due to your lack of
inputs and interest in the issue and the fact that you published the issue
against my express wishes. I am writing entirely out of respect for them.

We will have other phone calls, you can come, if you want to. You can come
back to the slack channel, if you want to.

One really unfortunate thing, for my esteemed colleagues informal systems,
is that this is very clearly preventing them from participating in the
triage.

So I'm writing to yourselves and to the people who pay you and I just want
to let you know politely and firmly that I believe that you are at present
a roadblock to security and a risk.

Good day,

-Jacob
