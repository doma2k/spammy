Please also note that there is no field length validation in IBC.

If banana king allows for oversized IBC transfer transactions which are
valid but still have a cost, the banana client allows for no cost oversized
client updates, which could then be broadcast from several addresses
simultaneously and continuously until the p2p Strom is triggered.

Banana King is a 100% proven and repeatedly used Way to make transactions
that in the wild have been up to 10 megabytes.

But IBC client updates on the cosmos hub are free and malformed client
updates are still gossiped.
