Furthermore, you have not been working with the stride team.

This issue happened on the stride blockchain network.

I am diligently attempting to give you a full understanding of the issue.

You ever requested artifacts and stuff, where are those? They're in the
slack channel.

This incident spans back two years.

Please let's try and have a call
