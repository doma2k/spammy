Hey so I would like to point out a certain piece in the readme file
governing security in cosmos.

As most are all of you are likely aware, I have been expressing severe
discontent with the response from amulet and the foundation concerning the
P2P storms issue.

And as most or all of you are likely aware, the p2p storms issue is laid
out thusly:


1) the guide document, scoped per Amulet way though I think we should
really consider issues like this holistically not atomically.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6C1xGdbFaTwJQkzevAHxFsqyUyL_vzJvunp5XESo60/edit?usp=drivesdk

2) the video - taking down the cosmos hub rs testnet with a method that's
much more effective on mainnet

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3SYI9xt7Z7VjyECweUDI5Ub1lgPf6at/view?usp=drivesdk

3) the analysis document

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oCjsVYMaV77etxOEbDxh58vkAQaXf7RAkhXvF_8GYis/edit?usp=drivesdk

4) the repository

GitHub.com/notional-labs/spammy


--------

Notional isn't looking to get sued by amulet or the foundation for doing
security research and following the directions of the foundations
leadership.

It is clear that the foundation and amulet do not commit to working with
researchers to understand vulns or they'd be doing that -- so I am fixing
the foundations security repository.
