I have begun to roll out governance proposals that reduce the maximum block
size across cosmos. By the end of the day, I should have done that across
every major chain.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3SYI9xt7Z7VjyECweUDI5Ub1lgPf6at/view?usp=drivesdk

I will continue to include this video on an at least daily basis until the
video is recognized.

I have kept records of all communications pursuant to this.

This email like all of the others will go in the records.

I don't know why it was not possible for amulet to take a phone call on
this matter, but I do know that I've never seen a low severity issue
require governance proposals on every single chain in order to maintain
their liveness.

Please I'm begging let's take these matters seriously.

-Jacob
