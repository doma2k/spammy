NOTE: THIS DETAILS AN ONGOING MATTER.

I'd like to politely urge that Amulet re-join the slack channel that Amulet
left so that Amulet can get sufficient context.


Greetings,

Here is a document on what I am calling "p2p storms".  They are a threat to
liveness on 100% of cosmos-sdk chains to my knowledge.

The document is under heavy revision because I believe that there are at
least two ways to cause a p2p storm:


   - Banana King
   - Spamming Client Updates


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oCjsVYMaV77etxOEbDxh58vkAQaXf7RAkhXvF_8GYis/edit?usp=sharing

For a relatively low cost, or in some cases at no cost, it is possible to
DOS entire chains in ways that reduce liveness significantly.

Reproducing this issue may not be viable on test networks, as the core of
the issue is the increased p2p traffic that large blocks cause, and a
resulting inability of the chain to process its mempool.

*P2P storms have been observed in the wild*

   - On Stride
   - On Sentinel

There's anecdotal evidence of p2p storms on Luna Classic *during* the
combined economic and infrastructure attack that took the chain down, and
you can find my documentation of this here:

https://github.com/notional-labs/notional/blob/master/incidents/WTF%20HAPPENED%20TO%20TERRA.pdf

Thus far, we've been coordinating in Slack channels, which I'm happy to
re-invite you to, since you left because that doesn't fit within your
protocol for dealing with security issues.

I've been coordinating with Jehan and I'm about to put a Banana King on hub
mainnet.  A few blocks of banana king is enough to trigger a p2p storm, as
is a few blocks of client update spam.  In fact on further consideration, I
think that the LUNC incident is no longer incidental.

I think that LUNC suffered a p2p storm during the attack, and that the p2p
storm was able to enable arbitrage, which is the entire threat model for
this attack.

*Recommendations*

1) drop sentry node architecture  -> to reduce the number of hops and nodes

2) validators connect to one another over vpn -> same goal as number one

3) reduce maximum block sizes <- I suggest 5mb

I need to update the document to add information about banana king.  Both
client spamming and banana king can trigger p2p storms, and p2p storms can
be arbed, and have been.
