It's all in the GitHub repository that you have access to.

It is also all in slack.

Cosmos hub governance has approved notional as the incident response
provider and it would be cool to like actually work with you guys on this
but it just doesn't seem to be what's happened.

In order to execute the attack, you simply use the shell scripts found in
the readme file of the spammy repository.

GitHub.com/notional-labs/spammy

So far I have not tightened the attack. I believe that it would be possible
to fully deprive chains of block production.

It would be nice if we could work together in that slack channel, we may
have been able to respond more rapidly. The attack in total deprives the
chain of block production by simply spamming a 50 kilobyte transaction.

It was fully successful on the cosmos have testnet.
