In previous messages, you have mentioned that you're talking with the comet
team.

IBC needs field length limit validation.

We have discussed this since the time of banana king, in one of those slack
channels that you've been invited to.

If we're fixing P2P floods lets also trim the banana.

By the way we have written a fix for this twice. It was rejected. If you
were in the slack channel, you'd know that maxtxbytes doesn't work.

Regards
-Jacob
