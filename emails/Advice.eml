Hi I am once again writing in hopes of receiving a response with coherent
guidance.

Throughout this process I have attempted to provide amulet and the ICF with
ample information to ensure that networks remain safe, and that our team
remains in compliance with all guidance and standards.

As previously expressed, we are very happy to follow guidance, however I
need too strongly express once again we have not received guidance from
amulet or the ICF.

The only applicable advice has been to form a working group of validators
on spam, which we have done.

Notional services about 40 chains in cosmos and has contractual
relationships with probably half of that number. In previous similar
incidents, we waited.  In one case, this resulted in loss of control of
funds for one of our customers, Quicksilver. The cosmos hub had a security
flaw and we didn't tell them.

On the day that we learned this news, we decided that that would never
happen again.

So we are beginning a lengthy process of distributing to all the teams that
we work with the fix to this issue.

At the request of Jehan Tremback, a cosmos hub forum post has been made.

The coordination challenge here is absolutely no joe. I am writing,
requesting assistance with that challenge. I do have stipulations however,
if Amulet is not willing to take phone calls and wishes to only speak over
email, I am very sorry but there is not a future for collaboration on
coordination on security incidents because this incident would not even
have been discovered, if it weren't for the fact that I spent the past ....
since August 15.... coordinating the issue.

Coordination in this space does not happen over email.

Thank you for any advice and assistance that you are able to offer

I am in Istanbul and I am available to meet with any relevant party in
person and demo the issue. Unless of course I don't trust them in which
case I would not show them this.

Jacob
