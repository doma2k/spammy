That document isn't new.

I've sent it several times.

Did you run the script in the GitHub repo you're a part of?

The video isn't new either.

Nothing is new except that you wrote back.

As always, I'm available for a phone call.  I have spoken with adi today
and he referred to this as a ddos.  This means he has no idea what it is,
which.... I think you're in a similar spot too and always have been.

I can be reached on signal.

You have the number.
