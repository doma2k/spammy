Hi Mo,

Notional labs would be a good credit.

You have not been working with the cosmos hub team as defined by Cosmos hub
governance.

Notional labs handles security on the hub, and Amulet has not even been on
a call with us.

The communications I have received so far from amulet do not show an
understanding of the issue, and I have repeatedly offered to walk you
through the problem.

Not only do I request credit for our work, I request to see the document
that you intend to release.

Regards,
- Jacob
