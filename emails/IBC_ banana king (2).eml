I can add these core teams to the GitHub, you know.

You can also just instruct them to synchronize the blockchain as I
mentioned above. At this moment I'm about to take off and maybe I can do
that during my flight but sir, surely email is not the best way to do this?

If you really must have email, you are on the repository in question, and I
would suggest that you review the readme file, as it contains the evidence
of that.

I know you have heard this a number of times, but I really do not think
that these emails have provided value or given you the needed context.

I don't honestly think that you understand the issue here, and I honestly
think that comms are the issue.

Will your team be at cosmoverse?
