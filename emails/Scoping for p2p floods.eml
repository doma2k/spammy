Whatever we can do to recognize the other scopes effected here would be
really excellent.

A handy summary across the four scopes of the flaw are in our report draft


Cometbft team:
-consensus issues resulting in an invalid proposer signature error
-p2p issues of an unknown type, could be a lack of throttling or back
pressure
Ibc-go team:
-client spamming
-lack of field length limits in ibc memos
-lack of field length limits in ibc for receiver in send transactions
-banana king -reported 1 year prior, published on Twitter 6 months prior-
and is referenced in this report
Cosmos-sdk team:
-gas fees above 0 do not limit the attack significantly
-mempool echoes / amplification seen 30+ minutes after attack conducted,
including next day
-invalid block parts error
[not for ownership of these groups] scopes for chain teams and/or
individual operators:
-ability to dos through globalfee whitelists, even with a 1mb block size
-maximum block size

We're happy to do anything we can to make this easier
